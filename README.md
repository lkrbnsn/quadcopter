quadcopter
======================

A simple Arduino based quadcopter firmware.

It uses the MPU9250 and the ArduinoMotionSensorExample (https://github.com/rpicopter/ArduinoMotionSensorExample)  library to control it.
It also uses the Arduino PID library (https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/) for the PID controller.

Everything is still a work in progress.
